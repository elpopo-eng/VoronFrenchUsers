1. Move your gantry so the side belts from the front idlers to the XY joints are separated center to center 150mm
2. Adjust tension evenly on both A and B belts until the lowest frequency in your plot registers approximately 110Hz

This value equals ~2lb of tension on XY, which is on the lower end of the range but should be a good initial setting (without stretching your belts too tight).The phone app I am using is called Sound Spectrum Analysis on iOS, the image below shows the output (not of my belts).
